#declaring all variables
num1= 99.23
num2 = 23
num3 = 150
string1 = "100"

#num1 into integer
print(int(num1))

#num2 into float
print(float(num2))

#num3 into string
print(str(num3))

#string1 into integer
print(int(string1))

#NB: How can I prove that eg. num3 is now a string, or string1 is now an integer? Simply using print(type(num3)) doesn't work as the casting only works within the print function above.
